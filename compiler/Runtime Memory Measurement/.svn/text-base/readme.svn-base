Process memory usage
a process's memory contains (VIRT SWAP RES  SHR CODE DATA)
VIRT = SWAP + RES. virtual memory  usageThe total amount of virtual memory used by the task. It includes all code, data and shared libraries plus pages that have been swapped out.
SWAP -- Swapped size   The swapped out portion of a task's total virtual memory image.
RES£ºresident memory usage  The non-swapped physical memory a task has used.
RES = CODE + DATA.
CODE -- Code size  The amount of physical memory devoted to executable code, also known as the 'text resident set' size or TRS.
DATA£ºData+Stack size  The amount of physical memory devoted to other than executable code, also known as the 'data resident set' size or DRS.
SHR£ºshared memory  The amount of shared memory used by a task. It simply reflects memory that could be potentially shared with other processes.

how to measurement
Use ptrace() to trace the process ,and monitor the   (__NR_exit_group 252) syscall,
then parser the /proc/process-pid/status ,get VmPeak virtual memory size ,
that's what i what.
