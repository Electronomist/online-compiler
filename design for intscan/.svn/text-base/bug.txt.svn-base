Session Variables Do Not Persist Between Requests After You Install Internet Explorer Security Patch MS01-055

SYMPTOMS:
After you install security patch MS01-055 for Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or 6.0, you may encounter the following problems:
Session variables are lost.
Session state is not maintained between requests.
Cookies are not set on the client system.
Note These problems can also occur after you install a more recent patch that includes the fix that is provided in security patch MS01-055.

CAUSE:
Security patch MS01-055 prevents servers with improper name syntax from setting cookies names. Domains that use cookies must use only 
alphanumeric characters ("-" or ".") in the domain name and the server name. 
Internet Explorer blocks cookies from a server if the server name contains other characters, such as an underscore character ("_").
Because ASP session state and session variables rely on cookies to function, ASP cannot maintain session state between 
requests if cookies cannot be set on the client.This issue can also be caused by an incorrect name syntax in a host header.

RESOLUTION:
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:
Rename the domain name and the server name, and use only alphanumeric characters.
Browse to the server by using the Internet Protocol (IP) address rather than the domain/server name.
Note You may need to change the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) configuration after you rename a server. 
For more information, refer to the "References" section.

That means the Session Variables lost problems is caused by the IE's design problems,for the domain i used 
"alex_zhang.intscan.org" contains '_' ,So IE lost session variables.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Test case:
session_test.php
<?php
session_start();
if(isset($_SESSION['hello']))
     $_SESSION['hello'] = $_SESSION['hello'] + 1;
else
    $_SESSION['hello'] = 1;

echo $_SESSION['hello'];
?>

Upload the php file to the alex_zhang.intscan.org,
IE: Remains 1  (F5 refresh the page)
Chrome: 1->2->3->4  (F5 refresh the page)

Copy the php file to the local wen server ,
IE: 1->2->3->4 (F5 refresh the page)
Chrome : 1->2->3->4 (F5 refresh the page)
