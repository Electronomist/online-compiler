To track the traffic to your site, there are two versions of the
Site Meter HTML available. One uses javascript and the other doesn't.
The javascript Site Meter can be more difficult to add to a page
(when using some HTML editors), but it allows you to track the
original URL from which your visitors came before linking to your
site. Because many  email servers will filter out emails that
contain javascript or even HTML, it was not included
in this email.

You can get the HTML for your account and the instructions for
adding it by logging into Site Meter at http://www.sitemeter.com and
selecting the MANAGER link from the top of the page. Then, from the
account manager page, select "HTML CODE" to get the HTML for your
account. From the account manager page, you can also make changes
to your Site Meter account like updating your email address, your
site's url, or the style of your counter.

If you have any questions about Site Meter please first check the
help page at http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=supportfaq

the service can be improved, please feel free to contact me at
